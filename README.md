# React GraphQL GitHub Repo Issue Checker

Consuming the GraphQL-based Github API, users can browse Github issues by entering an organization's repo name. Assumes a forward slash between both fields, as in "facebook/create-react-app".

Obviously poor form validation but this is a great practice application for building GraphQL applications, based on Robin Wierich's [The Road to GraphQL](https://roadtoreact.com/course-details?courseId=THE_ROAD_TO_GRAPHQL).

Watch for more features and styling soon.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn` or `yarn install`

then:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
